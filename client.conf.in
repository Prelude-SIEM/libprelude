[prelude]

# This is the default configuration for program client of a manager
# (sensors and agents) that use libprelude.
#
# Entry in this configuration file might be overriden by entry directly
# provided by the sensors/agents configuration file.


# Try to connect on a Manager listening on 127.0.0.1.
#
# server-addr = x.x.x.x:port || y.y.y.y && z.z.z.z
#
# This mean the emission should occur on x.x.x.x:port or, if it fail,
# on y.y.y.y and z.z.z.z (if one of the two host in the AND fail,
# the emission will be considered as failed involving saving the
# message locally).

server-addr = 127.0.0.1


# The following settings instruct the operating system when to consider
# a connection dead in case sent data is left unacknowledged.
#
# Theses option are operating system specific, and might not work on
# certain platform. In case you modify these settings on an unsupported
# system, a warning message will be issued when the agent starts.
#
# Under Linux, the default system wide configuration is:
# tcp-keepalive-time   = 7200
# tcp-keepalive-probes = 9
# tcp-keepalive-intvl  = 75
#
# tcp-keepalive-time represents the number of seconds the connection
# needs to be idle before TCP begins sending out keep-alive probes.
#
# tcp-keepalive-probes represent the number of not acknowledged probes
# to send before considering the connection dead.
#
# tcp-keepalive-intvl represents the interval between subsequent
# keepalive probes.
#
# The average time to notice a dead connection can be calculated using:
# tcp-keepalive-time + (tcp-keepalive-probes * tcp-keepalive-intvl)
#
# Here is an example configuration:
# tcp-keepalive-time   = 60
# tcp-keepalive-probes = 3
# tcp-keepalive-intvl  = 10
#
# Using the above settings, a dead connection will be detected within
# 90 seconds.


#
# TLS options (only available with GnuTLS 2.2.0 or higher):
#
# Sets priorities for the ciphers, key exchange methods, macs and
# compression methods.
#
# "NORMAL" option enables all "secure" ciphersuites. The 256-bit
# ciphers are included as a fallback only. The ciphers are sorted by
# security margin.
#
# "SECURE128" flag enables all "secure" ciphersuites with ciphers up to
# 128 bits, sorted by security margin.
#
# "SECURE256" flag enables all "secure" ciphersuites including the 256
# bit ciphers, sorted by security margin.
#
# "EXPORT" all the ciphersuites are enabled, including the low-security
# 40 bit ciphers.
#
# "NONE" nothing is enabled. This disables even protocols and
# compression methods.
#
# Note that much more settings might be enabled or disabled using this
# option: please see gnutls_priority_init(3) for more details.
#
# The default settings is "NORMAL".
# tls-options = NORMAL
