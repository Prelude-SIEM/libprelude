* 2014-09-16, libprelude-1.2.6rc1:

Author: Yoann Vandoorselaere

- Various improvements

    - Fix valgrind memory leak warnings

    - Allow creation of IDMEFPath relative to a root

        Example: idmef_path_new_from_root_fast(&path, IDMEF_CLASS_ID_ANALYZER, "name");
        will create an IDMEFPath that references the 'name' attribute of an
        idmef_analyzer_t object.

    - Introduce the idmef_object_t datatype

        IDMEF datatype now contain their own ID, so that it is possible for API
        using them anonymously to know which object they are currently being
        dealing with.

    - Ability to cast from IDMEFCriteria to idmef_criteria_t

    - Implement idmef_class_print() function
      It is now possible to generically convert any IDMEF object to string.

    - IDMEFPath support for key as index

        Example: idmef.Set("alert.additional_data('My Key').data", "data");
        will create a new AdditionalData object whose key is 'My Key',
        and data is 'data' (the object "meaning" field will thus contain the key).

    - Verify ABI compatibility in prelude_init()

    - Support for IDMEF object in Set()

- Corrections

    - Newly added timer did not expire when expected

    - Add missing IDMEF equal operator

    - prelude-linked-object members ordering fixes, so that the members are
      synchronized with listed idmef_object_t.

    - Fix asynchronous stack / high level bindings callback deadlock

- Compilation fixes

    - Various SWIG fixes

    - Use Prelude namespace explicitely, prevent error when included from other project

    - Include high- and low-level bindings generated code in the repository

        A reference version avoids using buggy or too old SWIG versions,
        do not automatically regenerate bindings by default.
        Warning : not compatible with lua 5.0 on Debian 7 and maybe other Linux

    - Enable Python 2.x Unicode coercion (include a SWIG patch from Brian Cole)

    - From now on, SWIG interface files are now installed
      This will be useful in order to generate libpreludedb bindings.

    - Fix make distcheck

    - Fix compilation with recent Flex version, update C code.



* 2014-07-07, libprelude-1.2.5:

- Various improvements

    - Improved error handling

    - In high level language, return an empty list if the path is ambiguous

    - Allow NULL idmef_value_t in list

        When retrieving value from a path, like alert.source(*).node.address(*).address,
        we also want to return undefined values, so that the returned list conforms
        to the number of item/index in the retrieved path.

    - Improved idmef_path_set() implementation

        It is now possible to set undefined elements, or override them.
        Additionally, append and prepend operation is now much faster.

    - Map idmef_value_type_id_t to a C++ enumeration

    - Provide __hash__ function for IDMEFValue class
      This allow Python sets() operation on IDMEFValue instance.

    - Explicitly activate thread support

    - Comparison operator support for IDMEFValue()

        Allow to directly compare two values together,
        without calling the IDMEFValue.Match() method.
        Add support of the Python "in" operator (item in valuelist).

    - New prelude_list_splice() / prelude_list_splice_tail() function

    - Add missing PRELUDE_SCN* definition

    - Improve AdditionalData type checking

    - Prelude-Timer optimisation

- Corrections

    - Various string conversion fixes

* 2012-06-04, libprelude-1.0.1:

- Fixed typo in setup.py.in

- Added packaging for rhel6

- Changed copyright

- Prevent freeing IDMEF message value on idmef_message_get_string()
  idmef_message_get_string() used to free the value within the IDMEF
  message, because prelude_string_get_string_released() was used. As
  a result, further idmef_message_get_string() on the same IDMEF path
  where returning null value.

- C++ compilation fixes
  Include idmef-data.h, required for idmef_data_t declaration.


* 2010-03-16, libprelude-1.0.0:

- C99 specifics formats are now available for public function using
  string formatting.


* 2010-01-29, libprelude-1.0.0rc1:

- Libprelude EasyBindings are now enabled by default

- Default to generating 2048 bits TLS keys

- Fix a potential IDMEF object copy/clone error return that could occur
  if the caller had freed a required children from the copied object.

- Prevent unsafe modification of the Libprelude returned Analyzer object

- When retrieving a list of IDMEF object, return a Python list
  containing one IDMEFValue for each object.

  This behavior is more consistant than retrieving a single IDMEFValue
  carrying the whole list, and might permit the user to play with the
  object directly if we extand the API in the future.

- Fix argv memory leak on bindings initialization

- Fixes some warnings uncovered by GCC -Wextra

- Thanks to Steve Grubb <sgrubb@redhat.com> for reporting Flexelint
  output! This allowed fixing the following issues:

  [prelude-admin]: fix possible leak on getpass() failure.

  [idmef-data]: fix potential invalid read on architecture where
                sizeof(char) > 1.

  [idmef-path]: idmef_path_set_index() would accept an off by one depth,
                protect the caller.

  [prelude-connection]: fix invalid pointer dereference in case of
                        malloc() failure.



* 2009-01-11, libprelude-0.9.25:

- Sent message priority will now be correctly assigned depending on the input
  IDMEF message.

- Fix critical warnings on destroy when assigning NULL value to IDMEF union.

- Fix Ruby include path detection on certain systems

- Fix idmef_data_t (type CHAR_STRING) mapping to high level language string,
  this prevent enclosing the terminating \0 when mapping an idmef_data_t of
  carrying a string to an high level language string (example: Python, Perl).

- Prevent a possible double free when a C++ IDMEFTime object was referenced
  from multiples place.

- Increase maximum protocol message size, the old size (1mb) could be a
  problem for systems sending very large alerts (example: CorrelationAlert
  with a lot of sources/targets). In the future, this limitation might be
  completly removed.



* 2009-07-08, libprelude-0.9.24.1:

- Use SWIG 1.3.39 to generate bindings code, fixes Prewikka compatibility
  problem because of SWIG version mismatch between libprelude/libpreludedb
  modules.



* 2009-07-08, libprelude-0.9.24:

- Initial prelude-log C++/Python/Ruby/Perl/Lua bindings support.
  This implement language bindings for the PreludeLog interface.

- Make the created profile permission fully respect required ownership.
  The analyzerid file within the created profile was incorrectly created
  with current ownership, rather than using specified uid/gid.

- Ruby and Python bindings were not properly checking whether the
  argument was a file descriptor in case the left/right shift IDMEF
  operator were used.

- Fix prelude-client initialization problem with empty argv[0], which
  sometime happen when called from certain high level language.

- Fix error in case of multiple initialization.

  by using the standard substring operator (<> or <>*).

- Automatically set IDMEFAnalyzer before sending IDMEF messages.

- Various bug fixes.



* 2009-04-22, libprelude-0.9.22:

- Fix C++ headers installation.

- Automatic, detailed ChangeLog generation (from http://live.gnome.org/Git/ChangeLog).

- Prefix C++ enumeration, implement IDMEFValue::Match() method,
  and provide IDMEFCriterion operator to be used by this method.

- Old behavior when returning an IDMEFValue was to map it's internal type
  to a type understood by the target language. Preserve this behavior unless
  the value contain an IDMEF class, in which case we now return the raw IDMEFValue
  (IDMEF class object are not handled by higher level language, but the value
  containing the class can be useful).

- Use pkg-config for GnuTLS and GnuTLS extra detection, and provide our own
  libprelude pkg-config file.

- Various bug fixes.



* 2008-11-14, libprelude-0.9.21.3:

- Update to libtool / libltdl 2.2.x

- Workaround libtool/libltdl 1.5 -> 2.x ABI compatibility issues. This
  introduce two fixes:

  Fix a crash when an application use a different libtool version than
  the libtool/libltdl version used to compile libprelude. In order to
  prevent this problem, we automatically rewrite the symbol table
  provided by libtool 1.5 applications, and make it compatible with
  libltdl 2.2 (we will now ship libtool/ltdl 2.2 as the default with
  libprelude).

  Automatic handling of symbol renaming between libtool 1.5 -> 2.x,
  which solve application linking problem.

  (fix #294).

- Cygwin compilation fixes.

- Fix compilation when IPv6 is not available.

- Fix possible compilation problem with some GCC version (fix #325).

- Fix path issue in case libprelude was configured with specific path
  outside of $prefix (fix #319).



* 2008-09-19, libprelude-0.9.21:

- libprelude now compile and run under Win32 native!

  and win32 backend.

- Automatic Node name and address detection, if the user did not
  provides custom parameters.

- When copying the value prior doing the cast, set the copy to not own
  the value data.

- When casting an IDMEF-Value fail, return the un-modified IDMEF-Value.

- Fixed non working uint32 and uint64 to time cast.

- Honor 'own_data' boolean when casting from/to a string (possible
  double free).

- Include unit tests.

- Correct C++ headers installation path.

- Fix Perl EasyBindings IDMEF->Read() method infinite loop.

- Handle new IDMEF value as new IDMEF object: return the old value if
  one already exist.



* 2008-08-04, libprelude-0.9.19:

- EasyBindings inclusion! EasyBindings provide simple C++, Python,
  Perl, Ruby, and Lua bindings for using libprelude. They are still
  considered experimental, thus you need to use (--enable-easy-bindings)
  to activate them. Thanks to Sebastien Tricaud <toady@inl.fr> and
  Pierre Chifflier <p.chifflier@inl.fr> for their contribution to this
  project!

- Use automake/autoconf for building/installing Python extension.

- Fix 0.9.18 regression (alert created with empty CreateTime).

- Implement reference counting for the idmef-criteria and
  prelude-connection API.

- Automatic casting when setting IDMEF Value to a field that is of
  different type. Until now, if an user tried to set a path of a
  specific type with an idmef_value_t object containing another type,
  idmef_path_set() would return an error.

- Various bug fixes.



* 2008-07-21, libprelude-0.9.18.1:

- Temporarily disable mutex locking while calling event handler, since
  we really need recursive mutex support for this task.

  the option is available, the user might specify TLS settings through
  the "tls-options" configuration entry.

- Workaround a GnuTLS issue where the client wouldn't be able
  to negotiate a supported compression protocol with the server (#299).

- Implement variable substitution in Prelude configuration files.

- Allow IDMEF criteria with multiples values for a single path,
  as can be seen in the following example:

  alert.classification.text = (A || B || C || D)

  This will be internally translated to the original criteria language:
  alert.classification.text = A || alert.classification.text = B || alert.classification.text = C || alert.classification.text = D

- Implement negation of idmef-criteria, allowing to write criteria like:
  ! (alert.classification.text = A || alert.classification.text = B)

- Fix an IDMEF-Criteria matching problem, where the match function would
  not attempt to match a OR after multiple consecutive AND that failed.
  Thanks Alexander Afonyashin <firm(at)iname.com> for pointing out the problem.

- Never use non-pointer field, always use the "required" keyword. Fix
  API consistency issue, that could lead to unexpected behavior.

- Fix multiples problem with prelude_read_multiline / prelude_read_multiline2,
  (fix a problem with prelude-manager idmef-criteria that wouldn't read
   external ruleset).

  for pointing that out.


* 2008-04-24, libprelude-0.9.17:

- Implement RFC 4122 UUIDv1 identifier generation, more resistant to
  duplicate than our previous implementation in case of clock skew, or
  multiple client with the same analyzerid sending alert in parallel.

- You can now provide NULL value to idmef_path_set() in order to
  destroy existing value within an IDMEF message.

- Unify memory handling of value retrieval through idmef_path_t. This
  allow the user to retrieve and keep any values, even through the
  associated IDMEF message is freed.

- Build system cleanup, enable RELRO when possible.

- Implement PRELUDE_CLIENT_FLAGS_AUTOCONFIG, which is set by default,
  but that applications might unset in order for their client not to
  read the default profile/global configuration.

- Fix possible assertion when destroying un-started prelude-client.

- Improvement to the prelude-io API, the user might now hook its own
  handling function.

- Fix dumping of (not) NULL criteria operator to string. Remove

          number as the position of the element from the low level API now allow
          to position the element at the specified (reversed) index. Using the
          high level API a negative index permit to address a list of element
          backward (replace an element).

        - Build fixes for SWIG > 1.3.27.

        - Modify idmef_value_match() so that it always unroll listed value
          (do it for both val1 and val2. Remove assertion, and let

          place of --(en|dis)able where we deal with external dependencies.

        - Rework configure script so that --with[out] work as expected (enabling and
          disabling the feature, explicit error if "with" feature is explicitly

          seem to suffer from this.

        - idmef-path API improvement, allow user to specify negative
          index to address the list in reverse. Developer are now

          IDMEF_LIST_PREPEND (in place of 0) on listed object operation.

        - idmef-path API improvement: support for (<<) and (>>) listed
          object index, meaning to prepend the object / to append it,

          deprecate the usage of (-1) previously used for appending.

        - Fix deconnection problem in client reading mode.

        - Improve option parsing: option value can now be provided using
          --option=value. This format is now a requirement for option that
          use an optional argument. Provide arguments information in the
          option help.

        - Fix deadlock on asynchronous prelude-client destruction.

        - Definitely fix the problem where prelude-adduser will, on some system,
          listen to Ipv6 IP address as the default: we now bind every address
          returned by getaddrinfo().

          notify the peer about the failure.


* 2005-01-09, libprelude-0.9.3:

        - Implement analyzer revocation in prelude-adduser. This will require an upcoming
          prelude-manager update so that revoked analyzer are denied to connect.

        - Make prelude-adduser use GnuTLS anonymous authentication in case SRP is not
          available. This is becoming a requirement since some distribution disable SRP
          support because of patent issue.
          We keep using SRP by default if both prelude-adduser instance has it.

        - Fix 0.9.2 regression, with a crash when providing prelude-adduser with option.

        - Fix potential OpenBSD compilation issue due to a missing dependencie in the

          did not already take care of it.

        - Workaround invalid library run path added through MakeMaker generated Makefile.

        - Fix Perl bindings Makefile generated with DESTDIR appended twice.

        - When compiling against recent GnuTLS version, don't link prelude-adduser to
          libgnutls-extra since, SRP symbols were moved to libgnutls.

        - If the user is running a modified GnuTLS version with the SRP API removed
          (namely, this happen on Fedora), warn the user that he should install GnuTLS
          from source, and that he might want to open a ticket on RedHat bug tracker
          about it.

        - Fix a problem where "MissingFunctionMacros" was reported instead of the function name
          on error.

          specify --uid and --gid anymore for each call to registration-server).

        - Fix a timer assertion in case we reconnected fine,

        - Make analyzer deletion work on all architecture.

        - Fix bindings Makefile so that they can be used with BSD make.

        - Stop using pcreposix for IDMEF criteria matching, always rely
          on POSIX regex. The way pcreposix define it's symbol make it impossible
          to use it from a library if the final program isn't linked against

* 2005-03-29, libprelude-0.9.0-rc1:

        Note: due to several years of work and the habit of working with the new
        version, it is hard to remind all the enhancement made in this release.
        Please bear with us and try it for yourself :-)

        - The Prelude framework has been stabilized, and a lot of consistency work
          has been going on.  The C API should remain mostly stable at this point,
          and we now offer Python and Perl bindings for interacting with Prelude.

        - C++ applications should now be able to compile with the library. New and
          powerful API like idmef-path (defining a path within an IDMEF message tree,
          assigning / retrieving it) and IDMEF criteria filtering has been introduced.

        - IDMEF draft 14 compliance.
        - Support for IDMEF optionnal integer in events.
        - A lot of work happened with the the IDWG to fix known IDMEF issue.
        - Message routing across distributed Manager for remote sensors administration.

        - The failover subsystem, used when the communication with a Prelude-Manager goes down,
          now support transaction and quota.

        - Message unique identity generation now done on the sensor side, and fully optional
          per IDMEF specifications.

        - Support Ipv6 for client/manager connectivity.

        - Use GnuTLS instead of OpenSSL. Authentication is now always done through TLS, and
          the encryption later can be dropped if the connection is local.

        - Usage of a single tool for sensor registration using SRP (Secure Remote Passwor protocol).

        - Allow multiple analyzer instance through the use of profiles.

        - Clean error handling. Application can now check the return value using
          prelude_perror(), prelude_strerror(), and prelude_strsource().

        - It is now possible to remotely query and set sensors options.

        - Make the plugin API allow different instance of one plugin to be loaded.

        - Allow recursive configuration file inclusion.

        - You can now define filesystem quota for failover.

        - Changed the way AND of manager work:
          When using {{ manager_addr = x.x.x.x && y.y.y.y }}, the emission used to stop if emission to x.x.x.x failed.
          However, from a practical point of view, people who use AND of manager for redondancy want both manager to
          receive exactly the same messages, even if one of the Manager fail.

          Thus, in case emission x.x.x.x fail, we still want to emit the message to y.y.y.y,
          and save the failed message associating them to x.x.x.x manager, for later emission.

        - Heartbeat now carry a status and an interval.

        - Use GnuLib for enhenced portability.

          a provided UID will have to be run using the registration UID.

        - Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>:
          Set generated certificate to start being valid one day
          before of the current time. This can avoid problem in case

        - Krzysztof Zaraska <kzaraska@student.uci.agh.edu.pl>
          Add AC_PROG_CPP so the preprocessor is detected before the OpenSSL
          presence test, so the OpenSSL detection works correctly.

        - Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>
          Use pthread_join() instead of pthread_cancel().
          The behavior of pthread_cancel too much depend on the architecture.

        - Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>
          Add a --pthread-cflags option to libprelude-config in order to
          avoid non threaded program to compile with pthread related option
          which might slow down program execution due to extra locking used
          by libc.
